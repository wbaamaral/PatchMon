## Where to Raise Things

Different kinds of contribution live in different places. This keeps the issue
tracker a true reflection of the project's stability, and keeps feature demand
somewhere it can be voted on and prioritised.

| What you have | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| 🐛 A bug or crash | **GitHub Issues** — use the Bug Report template |
| 💡 A feature idea | **[feedback.patchmon.net](https://feedback.patchmon.net)** — vote, comment, follow progress |
| ❓ A question or "how do I…?" | **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/PatchMon/PatchMon/discussions)** |
| 📚 A documentation fix | **A pull request** against this repository |
| 🔒 A security vulnerability | **[Private advisory](https://github.com/PatchMon/PatchMon/security/advisories/new)** — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) |
| 💬 General chat | **[Discord](https://patchmon.net/discord)** |

Bug Report is the only issue template, so anything else you pick from the "New
issue" screen takes you straight to the right place before you start writing.

Each of these is explained in more depth in the help centre on the feedback
portal:

- [How the Feedback Portal works](https://feedback.patchmon.net/hc/how-we-work/how-the-feedback-portal-works) — boards, roadmaps and where everything goes
- [Where to report a bug](https://feedback.patchmon.net/hc/how-we-work/where-to-report-a-bug) — what to include and why bugs stay on GitHub
- [How a feature request gets built](https://feedback.patchmon.net/hc/how-we-work/how-a-feature-request-gets-built) — the statuses, the review queue and how votes are used
- [Asking a question or how-to](https://feedback.patchmon.net/hc/how-we-work/asking-a-question) — Discussions vs bug vs feature request
- [Contributing code](https://feedback.patchmon.net/hc/how-we-work/contributing-code) — the short version of this document

If something feature-shaped does land in the issue tracker, a maintainer will
label it `enhancement`, move it to the feedback portal, add a comment with the
direct link, and close the issue, so nothing you wrote is lost. Follow it on the
portal from there.

The portal and this repository are linked by hand rather than by an integration,
so comments do not sync between them. Once a request has moved, the portal post
is where the discussion continues.

### Before you write code for a new feature

**Please get the request accepted before you build it.**

Feature requests on the feedback portal go through review before they reach the
roadmap. A request that has not been accepted may be declined or deferred — and
we would much rather tell you that before you spend a weekend on it than after.

If you open a feature PR without an accepted request, we will label it
`needs-accepted-request` and link the feedback post. **We will not close it.**
Once the request is accepted, the PR gets reviewed normally.

Bug fixes and documentation improvements do not need this — just open the PR.

### Our current focus: stability

We are prioritising stability over new features for the next few release cycles.
Feature PRs raised during this period may be labelled `deferred-stability-phase`
and revisited later. That is a scheduling decision, not a rejection.

---

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, constructive and patient. We want PatchMon to be a welcoming project for contributors of every background and experience level.

- Assume good intent.
- Give feedback on the work, not the person.
- Keep discussions focused and civil on GitHub, Discord and email.
- Harassment, discrimination or personal attacks will not be tolerated. Report concerns privately to **support@patchmon.net**.

---

## Ways to Contribute

You don't have to write code to contribute. Valued contributions include:

- **Bug reports** - open an issue with reproduction steps, expected vs actual behaviour, and environment details.
- **Feature requests** - raise them at [feedback.patchmon.net](https://feedback.patchmon.net), where they can be voted on and prioritised. Describe the problem first, then the proposed solution.
- **Documentation** - fix typos, clarify steps, add missing detail.
- **Code** - bug fixes, new features, refactors, test coverage.
- **Community support** - answer questions on Discord, help new users.

### Good first issues

Looking for a starting point? Check issues labelled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/PatchMon/PatchMon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or [`help wanted`](https://github.com/PatchMon/PatchMon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

---

## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository at [github.com/PatchMon/PatchMon](https://github.com/PatchMon/PatchMon).
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/PatchMon.git
   cd PatchMon
   ```
3. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/short-description
   ```
4. Make your changes, test them locally, and open a pull request.

## Repository Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `server-source-code/` | Go server (API + embedded frontend + migrations) |
| `agent-source-code/` | Go agent (Linux, FreeBSD, Windows) |
| `frontend/` | React + Vite frontend, bundled into the server binary |
| `docker/` | Dockerfiles and compose files |
| `agents/` | Prebuilt agent binaries and install/remove scripts |
| `tools/` | Developer tooling |

---

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- **Go** 1.26+
- **Node.js** 22+
- **PostgreSQL** 17
- **Redis** 7
- **Docker** & **Docker Compose** (recommended for running the stack)
- **Make**

### Running the stack

The fastest way to spin up a full dev environment:

```bash
# From repo root
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

This starts Postgres, Redis and the server with live reload on Go source changes.

### Server-only

```bash
cd server-source-code
make run            # Build and run
make run-pprof      # Run with ENABLE_PPROF=true
```

### Frontend-only

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev         # Dev server on port 3000, proxies /api to :3001
```

### Agent-only

```bash
cd agent-source-code
make build          # Build native binary
make build-all      # Build all platforms
```

### Building the Docker image

```bash
./docker/build.sh                    # builds patchmon-server:local
./docker/build.sh --tag mytag        # custom image tag
./docker/build.sh --version 2.0.1    # pin the version it reports
```

Use this rather than calling `docker build` directly. The git tag is the only
place a version is declared: no source file contains one, so the version has to
be passed into the image as a build arg, and `.dockerignore` excludes `.git` so
the Dockerfile cannot work it out for itself. `docker/build.sh` derives it from
`git describe --tags --abbrev=0` and passes it through, along with building the
agent binaries the image bundles.

If you would rather drive `docker build` yourself:

```bash
docker build -f docker/server.Dockerfile \
  --build-arg VERSION="$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 | sed 's/^v//')" \
  -t patchmon-server:local .
```

Only bare `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` is accepted. The server parses versions as
dot-separated integers and discards parse errors, so anything with a suffix
(`2.0.2-60-gabc1234`, `dev`) silently reads as `2.0.0` and makes the instance
think an update is available. The build rejects those rather than letting it
through. Omitting `VERSION` entirely builds an image reporting `0.0.0`, which is
a deliberate signal that the version was never injected.

The version is worked out with `git describe`, which walks back through history
to find the nearest tag. A shallow clone (`git clone --depth 1`) has no history
to walk, and fetching tags alone does not fix that. Run
`git fetch --unshallow --tags`, or pass `--version` explicitly.

### Your pull request should not contain

- **A version bump.** Nothing in this repository declares a version. Both
  `config.DefaultVersion` and `pkgversion.Version` are `0.0.0` placeholders that
  every build path overwrites from the git tag. Editing them by hand is always
  the wrong fix.
- **Release notes.** Release notes are written in the body of the GitHub
  release. CI reads them back at build time and compiles them in. Any
  `RELEASE_NOTES_*.md` you add will be ignored and overwritten.

### Further reading

Longer explanations of the build mechanics live in the help centre:

- [Building PatchMon locally](https://feedback.patchmon.net/hc/developing-patchmon/building-patchmon-locally)
- [How versioning works](https://feedback.patchmon.net/hc/developing-patchmon/how-versioning-works)
- [How a release happens](https://feedback.patchmon.net/hc/developing-patchmon/how-a-release-happens)
- [What happens when you open a pull request](https://feedback.patchmon.net/hc/developing-patchmon/what-happens-when-you-open-a-pull-request)

This file stays the authority on the exact commands, because it lives with the
code and moves when the build does. The articles explain the why.

## Running Tests & Linters

**All PRs must pass lint and tests before review.**

### Go (server & agent)

```bash
# From server-source-code/ or agent-source-code/
make check          # fmt-check + vet + golangci-lint + tests
make test           # Tests only
make test-coverage  # Tests + HTML coverage report
```

`make check` is the single command CI runs. If it passes locally, your PR will pass the Go checks.

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npx biome check --write src/    # Auto-fix style + lint
npx biome check src/            # Verify clean
npm run test:run                # Run Vitest suite
```

**All frontend PRs must pass `npx biome check src/` with zero errors and zero warnings** before being submitted.

### Frontend data fetching and refresh

Server state is held by TanStack Query. The client defaults in `src/main.jsx` are
`staleTime: 60s` and `refetchOnWindowFocus: true`. Those two move together: focus and mount
refetching only act on queries that are already stale, so raising `staleTime` back to several
minutes quietly turns both off for the whole app. Guard tests in
`src/__tests__/pageRefresh.test.jsx` will fail the build if either is changed that way.

If you add a page or a Refresh button:

1. **Use `usePageRefresh(keys)` from `src/hooks/usePageRefresh.js`.** Pass every query key the
   screen renders from, not just the main one. Pages commonly mount ten or more queries, and a
   button bound to a single `refetch()` refreshes one panel while the rest keep showing cached
   values. The hook also drives the spinner from all the keys, so it keeps turning until the
   slowest panel lands. Keys match by prefix, so `["hosts"]` covers `["hosts", params]`.
2. **Invalidate the whole scope a mutation affects.** Host membership changes go through
   `invalidateHostScope()` in `src/utils/queryScopes.js`, because the sidebar counters and the
   dashboard cards read the same rows under different keys. Add to that helper rather than
   listing keys at each call site.
3. **Do not hydrate a form from query data unconditionally.** An effect of the shape
   `useEffect(() => setForm(data), [data])` discards whatever the user has typed as soon as a
   refetch lands. Guard it on the component's dirty flag, and clear that flag in the mutation's
   `onSuccess` so the saved values re-hydrate.
4. **Prefer focus refetching over polling.** A `refetchInterval` runs against every open tab and
   does not fire while a tab is in the background. Reserve it for genuinely live data, and keep an
   eye on how expensive the endpoint is.

### Database schema changes

If you change the database schema:

1. Edit `server-source-code/internal/sqlc/schema/schema.sql`.
2. Add or modify queries in `internal/sqlc/queries/*.sql`.
3. Run `make sqlc-generate` from `server-source-code/`.
4. Add a migration in `internal/migrate/migrations/` with both `.up.sql` and `.down.sql` files. **Check the directory for the latest migration number before choosing yours** - duplicate numbers crash startup.
5. Run `make check`.

Never edit files in `internal/db/` - they are generated by sqlc.

## Commit Conventions

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Every commit message should start with a type:

| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `feat:` | New user-facing feature |
| `fix:` | Bug fix |
| `docs:` | Documentation only |
| `style:` | Formatting, no code change |
| `refactor:` | Code change that is neither a fix nor a feature |
| `perf:` | Performance improvement |
| `test:` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore:` | Build, tooling, dependencies |
| `ci:` | CI / pipeline changes |

**Examples:**

```
feat(patching): add dry-run retry for offline hosts
fix(auth): prevent session fixation on login
docs(readme): clarify Docker quick start
refactor(store): move host queries into HostsStore
```

Scope is optional but helpful (`feat(patching)`, `fix(agent)`, `docs(api)`, etc.).

### Signed commits

We do not require GPG-signed commits, but they are welcome.

---

## AI-Assisted Contributions

AI-assisted contributions are welcome. Tools like Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, ChatGPT and others can meaningfully speed up development - but reviewers need context to evaluate the change, and we need to know a human has actually read and understood it.

### Disclosure is required

**If AI was used in any meaningful way to produce the contribution, disclose it in the pull request description.** "Meaningful" includes: generating code, tests, documentation, commit messages, or PR descriptions; agentic / multi-step workflows; or AI-driven refactoring. Using an editor's autocomplete or a spell-checker does not need disclosure.

Include the following block in your PR description:

```markdown
## AI Disclosure

- **Used AI:** yes / no
- **Model(s):** e.g. Claude Opus 4.7, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Harness / tool:** e.g. Claude Code CLI, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, ChatGPT web, n8n workflow
- **Scope:** what AI produced (code / tests / docs / commit messages / full PR / partial)
- **Human review completed:** yes / no - who reviewed and what was checked
```

If you did not use AI, a single line is enough:

```markdown
## AI Disclosure

No AI used.
```

### Contributor responsibilities

You remain fully responsible for any code you submit, AI-assisted or not. That specifically means:

- **You have read every line** of the change, not just the diff summary.
- **You understand what it does** and can answer review questions without re-prompting the AI.
- **You have run the tests and linters locally** (`make check`, `npx biome check src/`). AI-generated code that has not been executed is not acceptable.
- **You have verified factual claims** - invented APIs, hallucinated package names, non-existent functions, fabricated documentation links, and typosquatted dependencies are common AI failure modes. Check every dependency name against its official source before adding it.
- **Security-sensitive code** (auth, permissions, input validation, crypto, secrets handling) gets extra human scrutiny. Flag any AI involvement clearly so maintainers can review accordingly.
- **Licences and attribution** are your responsibility. Don't submit code an AI may have reproduced verbatim from a GPL-incompatible source.

### What we do with the disclosure

AI disclosure is used for review context, not as a judgement. Maintainers may ask additional questions, request extra tests, or apply tighter scrutiny to security-sensitive AI-generated changes. Undisclosed AI use that is discovered during review will delay the PR and may be closed without merge.

## Pull Request Process

1. **One change per PR.** Keep PRs focused and reviewable. Big refactors can be split into multiple PRs.
2. **Write a clear PR description.** Explain:
   - What problem the PR solves.
   - How it solves it.
   - How you tested it.
   - Any follow-up work or known limitations.
3. **Link related issues.** Use `Closes #123` or `Fixes #456` so the issue auto-closes on merge.
4. **Keep the branch up to date** with `main`. Rebase or merge as you prefer.
5. **Respond to review feedback** promptly. Push fixes as new commits; we'll squash on merge.
6. **CI must pass.** Lint, tests and build checks all have to be green.

### PR size guidance

- < 400 lines changed: easy to review, fast merge.
- 400-1000 lines: OK if cohesive, but consider splitting.
- \> 1000 lines: please discuss with maintainers on Discord first.

### What maintainers look for

- Correctness - does it do what it says, without regressions?
- Tests - is the new code covered?
- Security - any auth, permission, input-validation or secret-handling concerns?
- Consistency - does it follow the patterns already in the codebase?
- Documentation - are user-facing changes reflected in the docs?

---

## Documentation

User-facing changes must include documentation updates in the same PR.

- **README.md** - high-level project overview, quick start, deployment options.
- **patchmon.net/docs** - full user documentation, hosted on BookStack. Sign in with GitHub; request editor access via Discord or email once you've verified.
- **Internal docs** - in `docs/Internal documentation/` (architecture, database, OIDC, WebSocket protocol, testing, etc.).

If you're adding or changing:

- An environment variable → update the env vars reference page on patchmon.net/docs.
- An API endpoint → update the integration/auto-enrolment API docs.
- An agent config option → update the agent config reference.
- The OIDC flow → update the OIDC setup guide.

---

## Internationalization (i18n)

PatchMon supports English (source) and Brazilian Portuguese (`pt-BR`). All user-facing strings must go through the translation catalog — never hardcode English text in components or API responses.

### Frontend (React)

Use `react-i18next` with per-page namespaces:

```jsx
import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";

function MyPage() {
  const { t } = useTranslation("my_namespace");
  return <h1>{t("title")}</h1>;
}
```

**Catalog files:** `frontend/src/i18n/locales/{en,pt-BR}/<namespace>.json`

- Keep `en` and `pt-BR` catalogs in exact key parity (enforced by `tools/i18n-check.mjs` in CI).
- Use `{{var}}` for interpolation: `t("toasts.saved", { name })` → `"Saved {{name}}"`.
- Use `_one`/`_other` suffixes for plurals: `t("items", { count })`.
- For module-level arrays (tabs, columns), use the `labelKey` pattern and resolve at render time.

### Backend (Go)

Use `handler.ErrorKey` for all error responses:

```go
// ✅ Correct — localized, includes error_key
ErrorKey(w, r, http.StatusBadRequest, "error.invalid_request_body")

// ❌ Forbidden — hardcoded English, no localization
Error(w, http.StatusBadRequest, "Invalid request body")
```

**Catalog files:** `server-source-code/internal/i18n/locales/{en,pt-BR}/errors.json`

The response shape is `{"error": "<localized>", "error_key": "<key>"}` — clients can use `error_key` for programmatic handling regardless of locale.

For non-JSON endpoints (WebSocket, streaming), use `http.Error` with `i18n.T()`:

```go
http.Error(w, i18n.T(r.Context(), "error.unauthorized"), http.StatusUnauthorized)
```

### CI enforcement

The `i18n-ratchet` job in CI blocks any new deprecated `Error(w,` calls (baseline is zero). If your PR adds one, the check will fail. Use `ErrorKey` instead.

To verify locally:

```bash
bash tools/check-error-i18n.sh   # backend ratchet (must be 0)
node tools/i18n-check.mjs        # frontend catalog parity
```

### Adding a new string

1. Add the key to the `en` catalog with the English source text.
2. Add the same key to the `pt-BR` catalog with the translation.
3. Reference the key via `t("key")` (frontend) or `ErrorKey(w, r, status, "key")` (backend).
4. Run `node tools/i18n-check.mjs` to verify parity.
