/**
 * Unified patch wizard. Every place in the app that initiates patching funnels
 * through this component for UI consistency.
 *
 * The wizard has up to six steps, rendered conditionally based on what is
 * already known when the wizard opens:
 *
 *   1. hosts      Select hosts (hidden when lockHosts=true, i.e. caller knows
 *                 the target host(s) already).
 *   2. packages   Select packages (only shown when multiple packages came in
 *                 and can be trimmed; hidden when lockPackages=true or when
 *                 patchType="patch_all").
 *   3. validate   Dry-run validation per host (trigger + patch_package only;
 *                 patch_all cannot dry-run server-side and approve mode
 *                 already has a validation run on file).
 *   4. timing     Per-host policy override + scheduled-at preview.
 *   5. approval   Decide whether to approve now or submit for approval later
 *                 (trigger + patch_package only — the only mode where a
 *                 pending-validation run can be left for a second approver).
 *   6. submit     Final per-host summary + the fire button.
 *
 * The visible steps list collapses down to just the steps that actually apply,
 * so e.g. a single-host Patch-all shows only Timing and Submit.
 *
 * Props:
 *   isOpen, onClose, onSuccess - standard modal contract. onSuccess fires
 *                      once per session with every run that was actually
 *                      created: onSuccess(mode, { runs, deferred }). After a
 *                      partial failure the wizard stays open and defers that
 *                      call until the user retries or closes, so the caller
 *                      never sees a run twice and never misses one.
 *                      `deferred` is true when the report was flushed on
 *                      close. Do not navigate away on it: the user asked to
 *                      close the wizard, not to be taken elsewhere.
 *   mode               "trigger" | "approve" (default "trigger")
 *   patchType          "patch_all" | "patch_package" (default "patch_package")
 *   packageNames       string[] | null - required for patch_package
 *   lockHosts          bool - hide the hosts step; hosts come from presetHosts
 *   lockPackages       bool - do not allow editing packages (informational)
 *   presetHosts        [{ id, friendly_name, hostname }] required when lockHosts.
 *                      In approve mode the same host may appear more than once,
 *                      one entry per pending run.
 *   validationRunIds   string[] - required when mode="approve"; each index maps
 *                      to the same index in presetHosts and is the existing
 *                      validation (or pending_validation) run to approve.
 *   restrictHostIds    Set|Array - (trigger/patch_package only) restricts the
 *                      host discovery step to these host IDs.
 *   initialStep        number - override starting step (auto-clamped to
 *                      enabled steps). Rarely needed; steps skip-ahead
 *                      automatically based on what props pin down.
 *   packagesByRun      { [runId]: string[] } - optional, approve-mode bulk.
 *                      When provided, the Submit step renders the per-run
 *                      list from this map instead of the global packageNames.
 *   patchTypeByRun     { [runId]: "patch_all" | "patch_package" } - optional,
 *                      approve-mode bulk. Drives the per-run render in the
 *                      Submit step; patch_all rows show a summary instead of
 *                      a packages table.
